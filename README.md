# Talk Story

Yes I know I say things I shouldn't. That's why my email address is liability@cancerdb.com.

I am sorry. If you're here right now there's nothing we are going to be able to do for you. We started too late.

But you can help someone else.

I need you to share your stories. https://github.com/breck7/talkToMoreUsers. What is happening. What types. What have you tried. What websites do you trust. What books do you trust.

Post here. Post on GitHub. Email me. Text me. Whatever you gotta do. Keep it on point. Keep it constructive. Do the next right thing.

As someone in this sub once wrote _never ever give up_.

I LOVE YOU.

_never ever give up_
